title: Layouts
---

Different routes of your app will often share common UI. Instead of repeating it in each `+page.svelte` component, we can use a `+layout.svelte` component that applies to all routes in the same directory.

In this app we have two routes, `src/routes/+page.svelte` and `src/routes/about/+page.svelte`, that contain the same navigation UI. Let's create a new file, `src/routes/+layout.svelte`...

```diff
src/routes/
├ about/
│ └ +page.svelte
+├ +layout.svelte
└ +page.svelte
```

...and move the duplicated content from the `+page.svelte` files into the new `+layout.svelte` file. The `<slot />` element is where the page content will be rendered:

```svelte
/// file: src/routes/+layout.svelte
<nav>
	<a href="/">home</a>
	<a href="/about">about</a>
</nav>

<slot />
```

A `+layout.svelte` file applies to every child route, including the sibling `+page.svelte` (if it exists). You can nest layouts to arbitrary depth.
