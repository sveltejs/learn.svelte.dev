title: trailingSlash
---

Two URLs like `/foo` and `/foo/` might look the same, but they're actually different. A relative URL like `./bar` will resolve to `/bar` in the first case and `/foo/bar` in the second, and search engines will treat them as separate entries, harming your SEO.

In short, being loosey-goosey about trailing slashes is a bad idea. By default, SvelteKit strips trailing slashes, meaning that a request for `/foo/` will result in a redirect to `/foo`.

If you instead want to ensure that a trailing slash is always present, you can specify the `trailingSlash` option accordingly:

```js
/// file: src/routes/always/+page.server.js
export const trailingSlash = 'always';
```

To accommodate both cases (this is not recommended!), use `'ignore'`:

```js
/// file: src/routes/ignore/+page.server.js
export const trailingSlash = 'ignore';
```

The default value is `'never'`.

Whether or not trailing slashes are applied affects prerendering. A URL like `/always/` will be saved to disk as `always/index.html` whereas a URL like `/never` will be saved as `never.html`.
