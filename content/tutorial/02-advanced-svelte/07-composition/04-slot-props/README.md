title: Slot props
---

In this app, we have a `<Hoverable>` component that tracks whether the mouse is currently over it. It needs to pass that data _back_ to the parent component, so that we can update the slotted contents.

For this, we use _slot props_. In `Hoverable.svelte`, pass the `hovering` value into the slot:

```svelte
/// file: Hoverable.svelte
<div on:mouseenter={enter} on:mouseleave={leave}>
	<slot hovering={hovering}></slot>
</div>
```

> Remember you can also use the `{hovering}` shorthand, if you prefer.

Then, to expose `hovering` to the contents of the `<Hoverable>` component, we use the `let` directive:

```svelte
/// file: App.svelte
<Hoverable let:hovering={hovering}>
	<div class:active={hovering}>
		{#if hovering}
			<p>I am being hovered upon.</p>
		{:else}
			<p>Hover over me!</p>
		{/if}
	</div>
</Hoverable>
```

You can rename the variable, if you want â€” let's call it `active` in the parent component:

```svelte
/// file: App.svelte
<Hoverable let:hovering={active}>
	<div class:active>
		{#if active}
			<p>I am being hovered upon.</p>
		{:else}
			<p>Hover over me!</p>
		{/if}
	</div>
</Hoverable>
```

You can have as many of these components as you like, and the slotted props will remain local to the component where they're declared.

> Named slots can also have props; use the `let` directive on an element with a `slot="..."` attribute, instead of on the component itself.
