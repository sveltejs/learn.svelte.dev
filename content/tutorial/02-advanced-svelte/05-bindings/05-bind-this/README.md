In a [previous exercise](onmount), we learned how to use the `onMount` lifecycle function to paint to a canvas.

But the example is buggy â€” it's using `document.querySelector('canvas')`, which will always return the first `<canvas>` found on the page, which might not be the one belonging to our component.

Instead, we can use the readonly `this` binding to get a reference to the element:

```js
/// file: App.svelte
+++let canvas;+++

onMount(() => {
	---const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')---
	const context = canvas.getContext('2d');

	let frame = requestAnimationFrame(function loop(t) {
		frame = requestAnimationFrame(loop);
		paint(context, t);
	});

	return () => {
		cancelAnimationFrame(frame);
	};
});
```

```svelte
/// file: App.svelte
<canvas
	+++bind:this={canvas}+++
	width={32}
	height={32}
></canvas>
```

Note that the value of `canvas` will be `undefined` until the component has mounted.
