title: The class directive
---

Like any other attribute, you can specify classes with a JavaScript attribute. Here, we could add a `flipped` class to the card:

```svelte
/// file: App.svelte
<button
	class="card +++{flipped ? 'flipped' : ''}+++"
	on:click={() => flipped = !flipped}
>
```

This works as expected â€” if you click on the card now, it'll flip.

We can make it nicer though. Adding or removing a class based on some condition is such a common pattern in UI development that Svelte includes a special directive to simplify it:

```svelte
/// file: App.svelte
<button
	class="card"
	+++class:flipped={flipped}+++
	on:click={() => flipped = !flipped}
>
```

This directive means 'add the `flipped` class whenever `flipped` is truthy'.
