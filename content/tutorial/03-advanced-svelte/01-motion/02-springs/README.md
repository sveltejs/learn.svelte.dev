title: Springs
---

The `spring` function is an alternative to `tweened` that often works better for values that are frequently changing.

In this example we have two stores â€” one representing the circle's coordinates, and one representing its size. Let's convert them to springs:

```svelte
<script>
	import { +++spring+++ } from 'svelte/+++motion+++';

	let coords = +++spring+++({ x: 50, y: 50 });
	let size = +++spring+++(10);
</script>
```

Both springs have default `stiffness` and `damping` values, which control the spring's, well... springiness. We can specify our own initial values:

```js
let coords = spring({ x: 50, y: 50 }, +++{
	stiffness: 0.1,
	damping: 0.25
}+++);
```

Waggle your mouse around, and try dragging the sliders to get a feel for how they affect the spring's behaviour. Notice that you can adjust the values while the spring is still in motion.
