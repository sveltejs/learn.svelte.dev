title: Adding parameters
---

Like transitions and animations, an action can take an argument, which the action function will be called with alongside the element it belongs to.

Here, we're using a `longpress` action that fires an event with the same name whenever the user presses and holds the button for a given duration. Right now, if you switch over to the `longpress.js` file, you'll see it's hardcoded to 500ms.

We can change the action function to accept a `duration` as a second argument, and pass that `duration` to the `setTimeout` call:

```js
export function longpress(node, duration) {
	// ...

	const handleMousedown = () => {
		timer = setTimeout(() => {
			node.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('longpress'));
		}, duration);
	};

	// ...
}
```

Back in `App.svelte`, we can pass the `duration` value to the action:

```svelte
<button use:longpress={duration}
```

This _almost_ works â€” the event now only fires after 2 seconds. But if you slide the duration down, it will still take two seconds.

To change that, we can add an `update` method in `longpress.js`. This will be called whenever the argument changes:

```js
return {
	update(newDuration) {
		duration = newDuration;
	},
	// ...
};
```

> If you need to pass multiple arguments to an action, combine them into a single object, as in `use:longpress={{duration, spiciness}}`
