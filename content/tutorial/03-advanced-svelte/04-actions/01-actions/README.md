title: The use directive

Actions are essentially element-level lifecycle functions. They're useful for things like:

- interfacing with third-party libraries
- lazy-loaded images
- tooltips
- adding custom event handlers

In this app, we want to make the orange modal close when the user clicks outside it. It has an event handler for the `outclick` event, but it isn't a native DOM event. We have to dispatch it ourselves. First, import the `clickOutside` function...

```svelte
/// file: App.svelte
<script>
	+++import { clickOutside } from './actions.js';+++

	let showModal = true;
</script>
```

...then use it with the element:

```svelte
/// file: App.svelte
<div
	class="box"
	+++use:clickOutside+++
	on:outclick={() => (showModal = false)}
>
	Click outside me!
</div>
```

Open `actions.js`. Like transition functions, an action function receives a `node` (which is the element that the action is applied to) and some optional parameters, and returns an action object. That object can have a `destroy` function, which is called when the element is unmounted.

We want to fire the `outclick` event when the user clicks outside the orange box. One possible implementation looks like this:

```js
/// file: actions.js
export function clickOutside(node) {
	const handleClick = (event) => {
		if (!node.contains(event.target)) {
			node.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('outclick'));
		}
	};

	document.addEventListener('click', handleClick, true);

	return {
		destroy() {
			document.removeEventListener('click', handleClick, true);
		}
	};
}
```

Update the `clickOutside` function, click the button to show the modal and then click outside it to close it.
