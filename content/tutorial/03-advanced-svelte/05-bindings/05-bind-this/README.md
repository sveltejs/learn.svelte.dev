title: This

The readonly `this` binding applies to every element (and component) and allows you to obtain a reference to rendered elements. For example, we can get a reference to a `<canvas>` element:

```svelte
<canvas
	bind:this={canvas}
	width={32}
	height={32}
></canvas>
```

Note that the value of `canvas` will be `undefined` until the component has mounted, so we put the logic inside the `onMount` [lifecycle function](/tutorial/onmount).
