title: HTML tags
---

Ordinarily, strings are inserted as plain text, meaning that characters like `<` and `>` have no special meaning.

But sometimes you need to render HTML directly into a component. For example, the words you're reading right now exist in a markdown file that gets included on this page as a blob of HTML.

In Svelte, you do this with the special `{@html ...}` tag:

```svelte
/// file: App.svelte
<p>{+++@html+++ string}</p>
```

> **Warning!** Svelte doesn't perform any sanitization of the expression inside `{@html ...}` before it gets inserted into the DOM. In other words, if you use this feature it's critical that you manually escape HTML that comes from sources you don't trust, otherwise you risk exposing your users to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/" target="_blank">Cross-Site Scripting</a> (XSS) attacks.
