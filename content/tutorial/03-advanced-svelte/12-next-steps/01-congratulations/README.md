You've now finished the Svelte section of this tutorial and are ready to start building Svelte apps. You can refer back to individual chapters at any time (click the title above to reveal a dropdown) or continue your learning via the [API reference](https://svelte.dev/docs), [Examples](https://svelte.dev/examples) and [Blog](https://svelte.dev/blog). If you're a Twitter user, you can get updates via [@sveltejs](https://twitter.com/sveltejs).

To get set up in your local development environment, check out [the quickstart guide](https://svelte.dev/blog/the-easiest-way-to-get-started).

Most importantly: since you're now a member of the Svelte community, you should [join our friendly Discord chatroom](https://svelte.dev/chat). That's where you'll find fellow Svelte users, and it's where we plan the future of the framework.
