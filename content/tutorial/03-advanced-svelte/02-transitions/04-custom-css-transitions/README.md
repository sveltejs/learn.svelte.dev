title: Custom CSS transitions
---

The `svelte/transition` module has a handful of built-in transitions, but it's very easy to create your own. By way of example, this is the source of the `fade` transition:

```js
function fade(node, { delay = 0, duration = 400 }) {
	const o = +getComputedStyle(node).opacity;

	return {
		delay,
		duration,
		css: (t) => `opacity: ${t * o}`
	};
}
```

The function takes two arguments — the node to which the transition is applied, and any parameters that were passed in — and returns a transition object which can have the following properties:

- `delay` — milliseconds before the transition begins
- `duration` — length of the transition in milliseconds
- `easing` — a `p => t` easing function (see the chapter on [tweening](/tutorial/tweens))
- `css` — a `(t, u) => css` function, where `u === 1 - t`
- `tick` — a `(t, u) => {...}` function that has some effect on the node

The `t` value is `0` at the beginning of an intro or the end of an outro, and `1` at the end of an intro or beginning of an outro.

Most of the time you should return the `css` property and _not_ the `tick` property, as CSS animations run off the main thread to prevent jank where possible. Svelte 'simulates' the transition and constructs a CSS animation, then lets it run.

For example, the `fade` transition generates a CSS animation somewhat like this:

```css
0% {
	opacity: 0;
}
10% {
	opacity: 0.1;
}
20% {
	opacity: 0.2;
}
/* ... */
100% {
	opacity: 1;
}
```

We can get a lot more creative though. Let's make something truly gratuitous:

```svelte
<script>
	import { fade } from 'svelte/transition';
	+++import { elasticOut } from 'svelte/easing';+++

	let visible = true;

	function spin(node, { duration }) {
		return {
			duration,
			css: t => +++{
				const eased = elasticOut(t);

				return `
					transform: scale(${eased}) rotate(${eased * 1080}deg);
					color: hsl(
						${Math.trunc(t * 360)},
						${Math.min(100, 1000 - 1000 * t)}%,
						${Math.min(50, 500 - 500 * t)}%
					);`
			}+++
		};
	}
</script>
```

Remember: with great power comes great responsibility.
