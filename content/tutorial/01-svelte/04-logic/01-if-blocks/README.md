title: If blocks
---

HTML doesn't have a way of expressing _logic_, like conditionals and loops. Svelte does.

To conditionally render some markup, we wrap it in an `if` block. Let's add some text that appears when `count` is greater than `10`:

```svelte
/// file: App.svelte
<button on:click={increment}>
	Clicked {count}
	{count === 1 ? 'time' : 'times'}
</button>

+++{#if count > 10}
	<p>{count} is greater than 10</p>
{/if}+++
```

Try it â€” update the component, and click on the buttons.
