title: Keyed each blocks
---

By default, when you modify the value of an `each` block, it will add and remove items at the _end_ of the block, and update any values that have changed. That might not be what you want.

It's easier to show why than to explain. Click the 'Remove first thing' button a few times, and notice what happens: It removes the first `<Thing>` component, but the _last_ DOM node. Then it updates the `name` value in the remaining DOM nodes, but not the emoji, which in `Thing.svelte` is fixed when the component is created.

Instead, we'd like to remove only the first `<Thing>` component and its DOM node, and leave the others unaffected.

To do that, we specify a unique identifier (or "key") for the `each` block:

```svelte
/// file: App.svelte
{#each things as thing (+++thing.id+++)}
	<Thing name={thing.name}/>
{/each}
```

Here, `(thing.id)` is the _key_, which tells Svelte how to figure out which DOM node to change when the component updates.

> You can use any object as the key, as Svelte uses a `Map` internally â€” in other words you could do `(thing)` instead of `(thing.id)`. Using a string or number is generally safer, however, since it means identity persists without referential equality, for example when updating with fresh data from an API server.
