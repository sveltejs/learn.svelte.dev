title: Declarations
---

Svelte automatically updates the DOM when your component's state changes. Often, some parts of a component's state need to be computed from _other_ parts (such as a `fullname` derived from a `firstname` and a `lastname`), and recomputed whenever they change.

For these, we have _reactive declarations_. They look like this:

```js
/// file: App.svelte
let count = 0;
+++$: doubled = count * 2;+++
```

> Don't worry if this looks a little alien. It's [valid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label) (if unconventional) JavaScript, which Svelte interprets to mean 're-run this code whenever any of the referenced values change'. Once you get used to it, there's no going back.

Let's use `doubled` in our markup:

```svelte
/// file: App.svelte
<button>...</button>

+++<p>{count} doubled is {doubled}</p>+++
```

Of course, you could just write `{count * 2}` in the markup instead â€” you don't have to use reactive values. Reactive values become particularly valuable (no pun intended) when you need to reference them multiple times, or you have values that depend on _other_ reactive values.

> Note that reactive declarations and statements will run after other script code and before component markup is rendered.
