title: Custom stores
---

As long as an object correctly implements the `subscribe` method, it's a store. Beyond that, anything goes. It's very easy, therefore, to create custom stores with domain-specific logic.

For example, the `count` store from our earlier example could include `increment`, `decrement` and `reset` methods and avoid exposing `set` and `update`:

```js
/// file: stores.js
function createCount() {
	const { subscribe, set, update } = writable(0);

	return {
		subscribe,
		increment: () => +++update((n) => n + 1)+++,
		decrement: () => +++update((n) => n - 1)+++,
		reset: () => +++set(0)+++
	};
}
```
