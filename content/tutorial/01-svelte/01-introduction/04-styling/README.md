title: Styling

Just like in HTML, you can add a `<style>` tag to your component. Let's add some styles to the `<p>` element:

```svelte
/// file: App.svelte
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<style>
+++	p {
		color: goldenrod;
		font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;
		font-size: 2em;
	}+++
</style>
```

Importantly, these rules are _scoped to the component_. You won't accidentally change the style of `<p>` elements elsewhere in your app, as we'll see in the next step.
