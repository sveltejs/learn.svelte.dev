Congratulations! If you've made it the entire way through this tutorial, you can now consider yourself a Svelte and SvelteKit expert.

You can start building apps on your own machine with the [`create-svelte`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-svelte) package:

```bash
/// no-file
npm create svelte@latest
```

Svelte and SvelteKit will continue to evolve, and so will this tutorial. Check back periodically for updates.

To keep up with developments in the Svelte world, join our Discord server at [svelte.dev/chat](https://svelte.dev/chat) and follow [Svelte Society](https://twitter.com/sveltesociety) on Twitter. We're so happy to welcome you to the Svelte community!
