title: Using parent data
---

As we saw in the introduction to [layout data](/tutorial/layout-data), `+page.svelte` and `+layout.svelte` components have access to everything returned from their parent `load` functions.

Occasionally it's useful for the `load` functions themselves to access data from their parents. This can be done with `await parent()`.

To show how it works, we'll sum two numbers that come from different `load` functions. First, return some data from `src/routes/+layout.server.js`:

```js
/// file: src/routes/+layout.server.js
export function load() {
	return { +++a: 1+++ };
}
```

Then, get that data in `src/routes/sum/+layout.js`:

```js
/// file: src/routes/sum/+layout.js
export async function load(+++{ parent }+++) {
	+++const { a } = await parent();+++
	return { +++b: a + 1+++ };
}
```

> Notice that a [universal](/tutorial/universal-load-functions) `load` function can get data from a parent _server_ `load` function. The reverse is not true â€” a server load function can only get parent data from another server load function.

Finally, in `src/routes/sum/+page.js`, get parent data from both `load` functions:

```js
/// file: src/sum/+page.js
export async function load(+++{ parent }+++) {
	+++const { a, b } = await parent();+++
	return { +++c: a + b+++ };
}
```

> Take care not to introduce waterfalls when using `await parent()`. If you can `fetch` other data that is not dependent on parent data, do that first.
