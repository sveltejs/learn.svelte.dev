title: Using both load functions
---

Occasionally, you might need to use a server load function and a universal load function together. For example, you might need to return data from the server, but also return a value that can't be serialized as server data.

In this example we want to return a different component from `load` depending on whether the data we got from `src/routes/+page.server.js` is `cool` or not.

We can access server data in `src/routes/+page.js` via the `data` property:

```js
/// file: src/routes/+page.js
export async function load(+++{ data }+++) {
	const module = +++data.cool+++
		? await import('./CoolComponent.svelte')
		: await import('./BoringComponent.svelte');

	return {
		component: module.default,
		message: +++data.message+++
	};
}
```

> Note that the data isn't merged â€” we must explicitly return `message` from the universal `load` function.
