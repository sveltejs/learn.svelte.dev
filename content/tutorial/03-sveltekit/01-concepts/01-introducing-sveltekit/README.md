title: What is SvelteKit?
---

Whereas Svelte is a _component framework_, SvelteKit is an _app framework_ (or 'metaframework', depending on who you ask) that solves the tricky problems of building something production-ready:

- Routing
- Server-side rendering
- Data fetching
- Service workers
- TypeScript integration
- Prerendering
- Single-page apps
- Library packaging
- Optimised production builds
- Deploying to different hosting providers
- ...and so on

SvelteKit apps are server-rendered by default (like traditional 'multi-page apps' or MPAs) for excellent first load performance and SEO characteristics, but can then transition to client-side navigation (like modern 'single-page apps' or SPAs) to avoid jankily reloading everything (including things like third-party analytics code) when the user navigates. They can run anywhere JavaScript runs, though — as we'll see — your users may not need to run any JavaScript at all.

If that sounds complicated, worry not, SvelteKit is the framework that grows with you! Start simple and add new features as you need them.

## Project structure

On the right, in the file tree viewer, you'll see a handful of files that SvelteKit expects to find in a project.

`package.json` will be familiar if you've worked with Node.js before. It lists the project's dependencies — including `svelte` and `@sveltejs/kit` — and a variety of `scripts` for interacting with the SvelteKit CLI. (We're currently running `npm run dev` in the bottom window.)

> Note that it also specifies `"type": "module"`, which means that `.js` files are treated as native JavaScript modules by default, rather than the legacy CommonJS format.

`svelte.config.js` contains your project configuration. We don't need to worry about this file for now, but if you're curious, [visit the documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration).

`vite.config.js` contains the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) configuration. Because SvelteKit uses Vite, you can use [Vite features](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html) like hot module replacement, TypeScript support, static asset handling and so on.

`src` is where your app's source code goes. `src/app.html` is your page template (SvelteKit replaces the `%sveltekit.head%` and `%sveltekit.body%` as appropriate), and `src/routes` defines the [routes](/tutorial/pages) of your app.

Finally, `static` contains any assets (like a `favicon.png` or a `robots.txt`) that should be included when your app is deployed.
