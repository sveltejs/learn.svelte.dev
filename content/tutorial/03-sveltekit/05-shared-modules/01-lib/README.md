title: The $lib alias
---

Because SvelteKit uses directory-based routing, it's easy to place modules and components alongside the routes that use them. A good rule of thumb is 'put code close to where it's used'. 

Sometimes, code is used in multiple places. When this happens, it's useful to have a place to put them that can be accessed by all routes without needing to prefix imports with `../../../../`. In SvelteKit, that place is the `src/lib` directory. Anything inside this directory can be accessed by any module in `src` via the `$lib` alias.

Both `+page.svelte` files in this exercise import `src/lib/message.js`. But if you navigate to `/a/deeply/nested/route`, the app breaks, because we got the prefix wrong. Update it to use `$lib/message.js` instead:

```svelte
/// file: src/routes/a/deeply/nested/route/+page.svelte
<script>
	import { message } from +++'$lib/message.js'+++;
</script>

<h1>a deeply nested route</h1>
<p>{message}</p>
```

Do the same for `src/routes/+page.svelte`:

```svelte
/// file: src/routes/+page.svelte
<script>
	import { message } from +++'$lib/message.js'+++;
</script>

<h1>home</h1>
<p>{message}</p>
```
